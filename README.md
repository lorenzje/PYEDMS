# Employee Discount Management System

## Overview
The **Employee Discount Management System** is a Python-based application designed to calculate employee discounts dynamically based on their employment type, years of service, and purchase history. The program enforces a maximum discount cap of $200 per employee while maintaining daily summary totals.

## Features
- **Dynamic Discount Calculation**: Calculates discounts using parameters like employee type (managerial or non-managerial) and years worked.
- **Robust Input Validation**: Ensures accurate data entry for integers, floats, and boolean inputs.
- **Modular Function Design**: Reusable functions for input validation, discount calculation, and result display.
- **Daily Totals Summary**: Tracks and summarizes daily purchase totals before and after discounts.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Provides clear and concise results for each employee and a final daily summary.
